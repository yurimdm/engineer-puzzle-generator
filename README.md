# The Engineer Puzzle Generator

You've probably seen and even played crossword puzzle magazines and also lots of other types of puzzle magazines during your life, they're not only fun but also good exercises for our brains. But have you ever thought of puzzle magazines based on digital electronics logic gates and other engineering student levels of puzzles? 

That's okay if you said no, most of the people probably did. But if you, just like me, think that's a fun idea, this project is meant for you. The Engineer Puzzle Generator generates puzzle magazine pages automatically and randomly so we can have as much fun as we want on this!
